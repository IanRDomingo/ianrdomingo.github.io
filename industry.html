        <p><strong>Applied Scientist Intern, Amazon</strong><br />
          <span class="tagline">Next-Gen Security Automation (SDO), 2025</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Worked on large-scale security data classification and database quality improvement using generative AI and machine learning models.
          Built end-to-end pipelines for analyzing noisy, heterogeneous security signals and mapping them into structured schemas for downstream automation.
          Designed evaluation workflows to measure accuracy, coverage, and failure modes.
          Collaborated closely with applied scientists and engineers in a production security environment.
          Internship resulted in a recommendation for the full-time L4 Applied Scientist pipeline.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Machine Learning Engineer Intern, iMetalX</strong><br />
          <span class="tagline">2024</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Developed machine learning systems for 3D reconstruction and multi-view geometry in manufacturing and metal trading contexts.
          Worked on data preprocessing, model prototyping, and evaluation of reconstruction quality under real-world constraints, including noisy inputs and limited annotations.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Co-Founder / Technical Lead, Checkless</strong><br />
          <span class="tagline">2024-Present</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Built a cloud-based restaurant analytics and inventory platform.
          Designed backend infrastructure using Supabase and PostgreSQL, with frontend deployment via Vercel.
          Implemented data pipelines and machine learning components to analyze restaurant operations and usage patterns.
          Led system design, database schema development, and deployment workflows, focusing on reliability and maintainability.
